Since I’m self-taught, I never had formal training in algorithms. But I’ve always enjoyed the challenge they represent, so here I’ll be sharing the problems I’m solving on LeetCode along with my personal notes and comments (in spanish for now).

To tun a file:

```bash
npm run intsall
npm run dev -- file.js
```
